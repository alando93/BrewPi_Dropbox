# BrewPi Dropbox

Basic python upload script taken from [Liudr's Dropbox Python API](https://liudr.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/dropbox-python-api/)

_dailyupload.py_ will running daily in the early morning and send yesterday's temperature log files to dropbox

_upload.py_ is copied onto the raspberry pi to be executable from ssh in case I need to specify a file to upload
